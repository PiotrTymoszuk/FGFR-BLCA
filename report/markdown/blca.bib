abstract = {Background Molecular characterization of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) may provide a biologic rationale for treatment response and novel therapeutic strategies. Objective To identify genetic alterations with potential clinical implications in NMIBC. Design, setting, and participants Pretreatment index tumors and matched germline DNA from 105 patients with NMIBC on a prospective Institutional Review Board-approved protocol underwent targeted exon sequencing analysis in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified clinical laboratory. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Comutation patterns and copy number alterations were compared across stage and grade. Associations between genomic alterations and recurrence after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Results and limitations TERT promoter mutations (73%) and chromatin-modifying gene alterations (69%) were highly prevalent across grade and stage, suggesting these events occur early in tumorigenesis. ERBB2 or FGFR3 alterations were present in 57% of high-grade NMIBC tumors in a mutually exclusive pattern. DNA damage repair (DDR) gene alterations were seen in 30% (25/82) of high-grade NMIBC tumors, a rate similar to MIBC, and were associated with a higher mutational burden compared with tumors with intact DDR genes (p < 0.001). ARID1A mutations were associated with an increased risk of recurrence after BCG (hazard ratio = 3.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.51–6.51, p = 0.002). Conclusions Next-generation sequencing of treatment-naive index NMIBC tumors demonstrated that the majority of NMIBC tumors had at least one potentially actionable alteration that could serve as a target in rationally designed trials of intravesical or systemic therapy. DDR gene alterations were frequent in high-grade NMIBC and were associated with increased mutational load, which may have therapeutic implications for BCG immunotherapy and ongoing trials of systemic checkpoint inhibitors. ARID1A mutations were associated with an increased risk of recurrence after BCG therapy. Whether ARID1A mutations represent a predictive biomarker of BCG response or are prognostic in NMIBC patients warrants further investigation. Patient summary Analysis of frequently mutated genes in superficial bladder cancer suggests potential targets for personalized treatment and predictors of treatment response, and also may help develop noninvasive tumor detection tests. High-grade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer has high rates of DNA damage repair gene alterations, mutational burden, and actionable alterations, making trials of novel targeted agents and immunotherapies warranted. ARID1A mutations are associated with recurrence after bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin therapy and may be a predictive biomarker and a potential therapeutic target.},

abstract = {Precision oncology relies on the accurate molecular characterization of individual patients with cancer at the time of treatment initiation. However, tumor molecular profiles are not static, and cancers continually evolve because of ongoing mutagenesis and clonal selection. Here, we performed genomic analyses of primary tumors, metastases, and plasma collected from individual patients to define the concordance of actionable genomic alterations and to identify drivers of metastatic disease progression. We observed a high degree of discordance of actionable genomic alterations, with 23% discordant between primary and metastatic disease sites. Among chromatin-modifying genes, ARID1A mutations, when discordant, were exclusive to the metastatic tumor samples. Our findings indicate that the high degree of lesion-to-lesion genomic heterogeneity may be a barrier to precision oncology approaches for bladder cancer and that circulating tumor DNA profiling may be preferred to tumor sequencing for a subset of patients.},

abstract = {Fatty acid metabolism (FAM) genes are potentially useful for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy response in bladder cancer (BC). To examine this, we constructed a prognostic model and identified key FAM genes in BC. Using transcriptional expression profiles and clinical data of BC patients from public datasets and Changhai (CH) hospital, we built and validated a risk-score model based on 13 prognostic FAM genes. Differential gene expression identified fatty acid synthase (FASN) as central to fatty acid metabolism in BC. FASN was differentially expressed between normal and tumor tissue, and was related to survival. In the CH dataset, FASN independently predicted muscle-invasive BC. FASN differential expression was significantly related to immune-cell infiltration and patients with low FASN expression responded better to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. SREBF1 was predicted as the most significant transcription factor for FASN. Competing endogenous RNA network analysis suggested that lncRNA AC107027.3 may upregulate FASN by competitively binding miR-27A-3p, thereby regulating the immunotherapy response in BC. Dasatinib and temsirolimus are potential FASN-targeting drugs. Our model efficiently predicted prognosis in BC. FASN is central to fatty acid metabolism, and a potential indicator and regulator of ICI treatment.},

For survival data, the statistical methodology to assess such schemes consists mainly of a range of ad hoc approaches, and there is an alarming lack of commonly accepted standards in this field. We review these methods and develop measures of inaccuracy which may be calculated in a validation study in order to assess the usefulness of estimated patient-specific survival probabilities associated with a prognostic classification scheme. These measures are meaningful even when the estimated probabilities are misspecified, and asymptotically they are not affected by random censorship. In addition, they can be used to derive R2-type measures of explained residual variation. A breast cancer study will serve for illustration throughout the paper.},

Our goal was to identify compounds and classes of compounds with efficacy in bladder cancer.

abstract = {Purpose: After cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), 60% of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) still have residual invasive disease at radical cystectomy. The NAC-induced biological alterations in these cisplatin-resistant tumors remain largely unstudied. Experimental Design: Radical cystectomy samples were available for gene expression analysis from 133 patients with residual invasive disease after cisplatin-based NAC, of whom 116 had matched pre-NAC samples. Unsupervised consensus clustering (CC) was performed and the consensus clusters were investigated for their biological and clinical characteristics. Hematoxylin & Eosin and IHC on tissue microarrays were used to confirm tissue sampling and gene expression analysis. Results: Established molecular subtyping models proved to be inconsistent in their classification of the post-NAC samples. Unsupervised CC revealed four distinct consensus clusters. The CC1-Basal and CC2-Luminal subtypes expressed genes consistent with a basal and a luminal phenotype, respectively, and were similar to the corresponding established pretreatment molecular subtypes. The CC3-Immune subtype had the highest immune activity, including T-cell infiltration and checkpoint molecule expression, but lacked both basal and luminal markers. The CC4-Scar–like subtype expressed genes associated with wound healing/scarring, although the proportion of tumor cell content in this subtype did not differ from the other subtypes. Patients with CC4-Scar–like tumors had the most favorable prognosis. Conclusions: This study expands our knowledge on MIBC not responding to cisplatin by suggesting molecular subtypes to understand the biology of these tumors. Although these molecular subtypes imply consequences for adjuvant treatments, this ultimately needs to be tested in clinical trials.},

abstract = {EGFR is a potential therapeutic target for treating bladder cancer, but has not been approved for clinical use yet. Metformin is a widely used antidiabetic drug and has demonstrated interesting anticancer effects on various cancer models, alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs. The efficacy of gefitinib, a well-known EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, combined with metformin was assessed on bladder cancer and underlying mechanisms were explored. This drug combination induced a strong anti-proliferative and anti-colony forming effect and apoptosis in bladder cancer cell lines. Gefitinib suppressed EGFR signaling and inhibited phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. Metformin amplified this inhibitory effect and enhanced gefitinib-induced activation of AMPK signaling pathway. In vivo intravesical treatment of metformin and gefitinib on syngeneic orthotopic mice confirmed the significant inhibitory effect on bladder tumor growth. These two drugs may be an excellent combination for the treatment of bladder cancer through intravesical instillation.},

abstract = {We study a framework for performing regularized K-means, based on direct penalization of the size of the cluster centers. Different penalization strategies are considered and compared in a theoretical analysis and an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study. Based on the results, we propose a new method called hard-threshold K-means (HTK-means), which uses an 0 penalty to induce sparsity. HTK-means is a fast and competitive sparse clustering method which is easily interpretable, as is illustrated on several real data examples. In this context, new graphical displays are presented and used to gain further insight into the data sets.},

abstract = {Purpose: T-cell dysfunction is a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM). Although anergy and tolerance have been well characterized, T-cell exhaustion remains relatively unexplored. Exhaustion, characterized in part by the upregulation of multiple immune checkpoints, is a known contributor to failures amid immune checkpoint blockade, a strategy that has lacked success thus far in GBM. This study is among the first to examine, and credential as bona fide, exhaustion among T cells infiltrating human and murine GBM. Experimental Design: Tumor-infiltrating and peripheral blood lymphocytes (TILs and PBLs) were isolated from patients with GBM. Levels of exhaustion-associated inhibitory receptors and poststimulation levels of the cytokines IFNg, TNFa, and IL2 were assessed by flow cytometry. T-cell receptor Vb chain expansion was also assessed in TILs and PBLs. Similar analysis was extended to TILs isolated from intracranial and subcutaneous immunocom-petent murine models of glioma, breast, lung, and melanoma cancers. Results: Our data reveal that GBM elicits a particularly severe T-cell exhaustion signature among infiltrating T cells characterized by: (1) prominent upregulation of multiple immune checkpoints; (2) stereotyped T-cell transcriptional programs matching classical virus-induced exhaustion; and (3) notable T-cell hyporesponsiveness in tumor-specific T cells. Exhaustion signatures differ predictably with tumor identity, but remain stable across manipulated tumor locations. Conclusions: Distinct cancers possess similarly distinct mechanisms for exhausting T cells. The poor TIL function and severe exhaustion observed in GBM highlight the need to better understand this tumor-imposed mode of T-cell dysfunction in order to formulate effective immunotherapeutic strategies targeting GBM.},

abstract = {Most of the effort in the semi-supervised clustering literature was devoted to variations of the K-means algorithm. In this paper we show how background knowledge can be used to bias a partitional density-based clustering algorithm. Our work describes how labeled objects can be used to help the algorithm detecting suitable density parameters for the algorithm to extract density-based clusters in specific parts of the feature space. Considering the set of constraints established by the labeled dataset we show that our algorithm, called SSDBSCAN, automatically finds density parameters for each natural cluster in a dataset. Four of the most interesting characteristics of SSDBSCAN are that (1) it only requires a single, robust input parameter, (2) it does not need any user intervention, (3) it automatically finds the noise objects according to the density of the natural clusters and (4) it is able to find the natural cluster structure even when the density among clusters vary widely. The algorithm presented in this paper is evaluated with artificial and real-world datasets, demonstrating better results when compared to other unsupervised and semi-supervised density-based approaches. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Despite considerable efforts to identify cancer metabolic alterations that might unveil druggable vulnerabilities, systematic characterizations of metabolism as it relates to functional genomic features and associated dependencies remain uncommon. To further understand the metabolic diversity of cancer, we profiled 225 metabolites in 928 cell lines from more than 20 cancer types in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This resource enables unbiased association analysis linking the cancer metabolome to genetic alterations, epigenetic features and gene dependencies. Additionally, by screening barcoded cell lines, we demonstrated that aberrant ASNS hypermethylation sensitizes subsets of gastric and hepatic cancers to asparaginase therapy. Finally, our analysis revealed distinct synthesis and secretion patterns of kynurenine, an immune-suppressive metabolite, in model cancer cell lines. Together, these findings and related methodology provide comprehensive resources that will help clarify the landscape of cancer metabolism.},

abstract = {For a decade, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program collected clinicopathologic annotation data along with multi-platform molecular profiles of more than 11,000 human tumors across 33 different cancer types. TCGA clinical data contain key features representing the democratized nature of the data collection process. To ensure proper use of this large clinical dataset associated with genomic features, we developed a standardized dataset named the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR), which includes four major clinical outcome endpoints. In addition to detailing major challenges and statistical limitations encountered during the effort of integrating the acquired clinical data, we present a summary that includes endpoint usage recommendations for each cancer type. These TCGA-CDR findings appear to be consistent with cancer genomics studies independent of the TCGA effort and provide opportunities for investigating cancer biology using clinical correlates at an unprecedented scale. Analysis of clinicopathologic annotations for over 11,000 cancer patients in the TCGA program leads to the generation of TCGA Clinical Data Resource, which provides recommendations of clinical outcome endpoint usage for 33 cancer types.},

abstract = {Continuous diagnostic tests are often used for discriminating between healthy and diseased populations. For the clinical application of such tests, it is useful to select a cutpoint or discrimination value c that deffnes positive and negative test results. In general, individuals with a diagnostic test value of c or higher are classiffed as diseased. Several search strategies have been proposed for choosing optimal cutpoints in diagnostic tests, depending on the underlying reason for this choice. This paper introduces an R package, known as OptimalCutpoints, for selecting optimal cutpoints in diagnostic tests. It incorporates criteria that take the costs of the different diagnostic decisions into account, as well as the prevalence of the target disease and several methods based on measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Moreover, it enables optimal levels to be calculated according to levels of given (categorical) covariates. While the numerical output includes the optimal cutpoint values and associated accuracy measures with their conffdence intervals, the graphical output includes the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and predictive ROC curves. An illustration of the use of OptimalCutpoints is provided, using a real biomedical dataset.},

abstract = {Bladder cancer (BC) is a common urological malignancy with a high probability of death and recurrence. Cystoscopy is used as a routine examination for diagnosis and following patient monitoring for recurrence. Repeated costly and intrusive treatments may discourage patients from having frequent follow-up screenings. Hence, exploring novel non-invasive ways to help identify recurrent and/or primary BC is critical. In this work, 200 human urine samples were profiled using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-UHRMS) to uncover molecular markers differentiating BC from non-cancer controls (NCs). Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses with external validation identified metabolites that distinguish BC patients from NCs disease. More detailed divisions for the stage, grade, age, and gender are also discussed. Findings indicate that monitoring urine metabolites may provide a non-invasive and more straightforward diagnostic method for identifying BC and treating recurrent diseases.},

abstract = {Molecular changes occurring during invasion and clinical progression of cancer are difficult to study longitudinally in patient-derived material. A unique feature of urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is that patients frequently develop multiple nonmuscle invasive tumors, some of which may eventually progress to invade the muscle of the bladder wall. Here, we use a cohort of 73 patients that experienced a total of 357 UBC diagnoses to study the stability or change in detected molecular alterations during cancer progression. The tumors were subtyped by gene expression profiling and analyzed for hotspot mutations in FGFR3, PIK3CA and TERT, the most frequent early driver mutations in this tumor type. TP53 alterations, frequent in advanced UBC, were inferred from p53 staining pattern, and potential genomic alterations were inferred by gene expression patterns at regions harboring frequent copy number alterations. We show that early driver mutations were largely preserved in UBC recurrences. Changes in FGFR3, PIK3CA or TERT mutation status were not linked to changes in molecular subtype and aggressive behavior. Instead, changes into a more aggressive molecular subtype seem to be associated with p53 alterations. We analyze changes in gene expression from primary tumors, to recurrences and progression tumors, and identify two modes of progression: Patients for whom progression is preceded by or coincides with a radical subtype shift, and patients who progress without any systematic molecular changes. For the latter group of patients, progression may be either stochastic or depending on factors already present at primary tumor initiation.},

abstract = {Tumor cells rely on aerobic glycolysis as their main energy resource (Warburg effect). Recent research has highlighted the importance of lipid metabolism in tumor progression, and certain cancers even turn to fatty acids as the main fuel. Related studies have identified alterations of fatty acid metabolism in human bladder cancer (BCa). Our microarray analysis showed that fatty acidmetabolism was activated in BCa compared with normal bladder. The free fatty acid (FFA) level was also increased in BCa compared with paracancerous tissues. Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) with etomoxir caused lipid accumulation, decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) levels, suppressed BCa cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and reduced motility of BCa cells via affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. Furthermore, etomoxir induced BCa cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) $\gamma$-mediated pathway with alterations in fatty acid metabolism associated gene expression. The cell cycle arrest could be reversed by PPAR$\gamma$ antagonist GW9662. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibition of FAO with etomoxir may provide a novel avenue to investigate new therapeutic approaches to human BCa.},

abstract = {Background: Bladder-sparing trimodality therapy (TMT)is an alternative to radical cystectomy (RC)for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), and biomarkers to inform therapy selection are needed. Objective: To evaluate the prognostic value of immune and stromal signatures in MIBC treated with TMT. Design, setting, and participants: We used a clinical-grade platform to perform transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling of primary tumors from 136 MIBC patients treated with TMT at a single institution. We observed 60 overall survival events at 5 yr, and median follow-up time for patients without an event was 5.0 yr (interquartile range 3.1, 5.0). Expression data from another cohort of 223 MIBC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)and RC were also analyzed. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Molecular subtype, immune, and stromal signatures were evaluated for associations with disease-specific survival (DSS)and overall survival (OS)in TMT patients, and in patients treated with NAC and RC. Results and limitations: Gene expression profiling of TMT cases identified luminal (N = 40), luminal-infiltrated (N = 26), basal (N = 54), and claudin-low (N = 16)subtypes. Signatures of T-cell activation and interferon gamma signaling were associated with improved DSS in the TMT cohort (hazard ratio 0.30 [0.14–0.65], p = 0.002 for T cells), but not in the NAC and RC cohort. Conversely, a stromal signature was associated with worse DSS in the NAC and RC cohort (p = 0.006), but not in the TMT cohort. This study is limited by its retrospective nature. Conclusions: Higher immune infiltration in MIBC is associated with improved DSS after TMT, whereas higher stromal infiltration is associated with shorter DSS after NAC and RC. Additional studies should be conducted to determine whether gene expression profiling can predict treatment response. Patient summary: We used gene expression profiling to study the association between tumor microenvironment and outcomes following bladder preservation therapy for invasive bladder cancer. We found that outcomes varied with immune and stromal signatures within the tumor. We conclude that gene expression profiling has potential to guide treatment decisions in bladder cancer.},

abstract = {Self-organizing map (SOM) is one of the most popular neural network methods for cluster analysis. Clustering methods using SOM usually are two-stage procedures: first original data are projected onto a set of prototypes on an ordered grid by SOM, and these prototypes can be seen as proto-clusters which will be grouped in the second stage to obtain finally clustering results. Many methods have been proposed to cluster the proto-clusters, among which the prototypes are considered as isolated vectors, without relationship of SOM; others are based on the U-matrix, which represents the local distance structure coming from the topology of SOM. In this paper, we propose a novel method more related to SOM for the purpose to cluster the proto-clusters. In the second stage we use the grid information alternatively, regarding it as a graph partitioned by graph cut algorithm well-known as Normalized cut. We apply this method on image processing and seismic data analysis and obtain reasonable results. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Effect sizes are underappreciated and often misinterpreted—the most common mistakes being to describe them in ways that are uninformative (e.g., using arbitrary standards) or misleading (e.g., squaring effect-size rs). We propose that effect sizes can be usefully evaluated by comparing them with well-understood benchmarks or by considering them in terms of concrete consequences. In that light, we conclude that when reliably estimated (a critical consideration), an effect-size r of.05 indicates an effect that is very small for the explanation of single events but potentially consequential in the not-very-long run, an effect-size r of.10 indicates an effect that is still small at the level of single events but potentially more ultimately consequential, an effect-size r of.20 indicates a medium effect that is of some explanatory and practical use even in the short run and therefore even more important, and an effect-size r of.30 indicates a large effect that is potentially powerful in both the short and the long run. A very large effect size (r =.40 or greater) in the context of psychological research is likely to be a gross overestimate that will rarely be found in a large sample or in a replication. Our goal is to help advance the treatment of effect sizes so that rather than being numbers that are ignored, reported without interpretation, or interpreted superficially or incorrectly, they become aspects of research reports that can better inform the application and theoretical development of psychological research.},

Higher PD-L1 IHC and immune pathway scores, but not angiogenesis scores, are associated with greater ramucirumab OS benefit. Additionally, Basal subtypes, which have higher PD-L1 IHC and immune/angiogenesis pathway scores, show greater ramucirumab OS benefit compared to Luminal subtypes, which have relatively lower scores. Multivariable analysis suggests patients from East Asia as having lower immune/angiogenesis signature scores, which correlates with decreased ramucirumab OS benefit.

This study assessed atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) as treatment for metastatic urothelial cancer in cisplatin-ineligible patients. Methods For this single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 study, in 47 academic medical centres and community oncology practices in seven countries in North America and Europe, we recruited previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were cisplatin ineligible. Patients were given 1200 mg intravenous atezolizumab every 21 days until progression. The primary endpoint was independently confirmed objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (central review), assessed in prespecified subgroups based on PD-L1 expression and in all patients. All participants who received one or more doses of atezolizumab were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02108652. Findings Between June 9, 2014, and March 30, 2015, we enrolled 123 patients, of whom 119 received one or more doses of atezolizumab. At 17{\textperiodcentered}2 months' median follow-up, the objective response rate was 23% (95% CI 16 to 31), the complete response rate was 9% (n=11), and 19 of 27 responses were ongoing. Median response duration was not reached. Responses occurred across all PD-L1 and poor prognostic factor subgroups. Median progression-free survival was 2{\textperiodcentered}7 months (2{\textperiodcentered}1 to 4{\textperiodcentered}2). Median overall survival was 15{\textperiodcentered}9 months (10{\textperiodcentered}4 to not estimable). Tumour mutation load was associated with response. Treatment-related adverse events that occurred in 10% or more of patients were fatigue (36 [30%] patients), diarrhoea (14 [12%] patients), and pruritus (13 [11%] patients). One treatment-related death (sepsis) occurred. Nine (8%) patients had an adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation. Immune-mediated events occurred in 14 (12%) patients. Interpretation Atezolizumab showed encouraging durable response rates, survival, and tolerability, supporting its therapeutic use in untreated metastatic urothelial cancer.

abstract = {Background: Cluster algorithms are gaining in popularity in biomedical research due to their compelling ability to identify discrete subgroups in data, and their increasing accessibility in mainstream software. While guidelines exist for algorithm selection and outcome evaluation, there are no firmly established ways of computing a priori statistical power for cluster analysis. Here, we estimated power and classification accuracy for common analysis pipelines through simulation. We systematically varied subgroup size, number, separation (effect size), and covariance structure. We then subjected generated datasets to dimensionality reduction approaches (none, multi-dimensional scaling, or uniform manifold approximation and projection) and cluster algorithms (k-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering with Ward or average linkage and Euclidean or cosine distance, HDBSCAN). Finally, we directly compared the statistical power of discrete (k-means), “fuzzy” (c-means), and finite mixture modelling approaches (which include latent class analysis and latent profile analysis). Results: We found that clustering outcomes were driven by large effect sizes or the accumulation of many smaller effects across features, and were mostly unaffected by differences in covariance structure. Sufficient statistical power was achieved with relatively small samples (N = 20 per subgroup), provided cluster separation is large ($\Delta$ = 4). Finally, we demonstrated that fuzzy clustering can provide a more parsimonious and powerful alternative for identifying separable multivariate normal distributions, particularly those with slightly lower centroid separation ($\Delta$ = 3). Conclusions: Traditional intuitions about statistical power only partially apply to cluster analysis: increasing the number of participants above a sufficient sample size did not improve power, but effect size was crucial. Notably, for the popular dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms tested here, power was only satisfactory for relatively large effect sizes (clear separation between subgroups). Fuzzy clustering provided higher power in multivariate normal distributions. Overall, we recommend that researchers (1) only apply cluster analysis when large subgroup separation is expected, (2) aim for sample sizes of N = 20 to N = 30 per expected subgroup, (3) use multi-dimensional scaling to improve cluster separation, and (4) use fuzzy clustering or mixture modelling approaches that are more powerful and more parsimonious with partially overlapping multivariate normal distributions.},

We sought to create a public resource containing the growth-inhibitory activity of 4,518 drugs tested across 578 human cancer cell lines. We used PRISM (profiling relative inhibition simultaneously in mixtures), a molecular barcoding method, to screen drugs against cell lines in pools. An unexpectedly large number of non-oncology drugs selectively inhibited subsets of cancer cell lines in a manner predictable from the molecular features of the cell lines. Our findings include compounds that killed by inducing phosphodiesterase 3A-Schlafen 12 complex formation, vanadium-containing compounds whose killing depended on the sulfate transporter SLC26A2, the alcohol dependence drug disulfiram, which killed cells with low expression of metallothioneins, and the anti-inflammatory drug tepoxalin, which killed via the multidrug resistance protein ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1). The PRISM drug repurposing resource ( https://depmap.org/repurposing ) is a starting point to develop new oncology therapeutics, and more rarely, for potential direct clinical translation. Golub and colleagues tested thousands of drugs not originally developed for oncology across 578 human cancer cell lines, revealing growth-inhibitory effects and providing a resource to identify drugs with the potential to be repurposed for cancer.},

However, the available methods have used limited sources for training and give only a partial portrayal of the full cellular landscape. Here we present xCell, a novel gene signature-based method, and use it to infer 64 immune and stromal cell types. We harmonized 1822 pure human cell type transcriptomes from various sources and employed a curve fitting approach for linear comparison of cell types and introduced a novel spillover compensation technique for separating them. Using extensive in silico analyses and comparison to cytometry immunophenotyping, we show that xCell outperforms other methods. xCell is available at http://xCell.ucsf.edu/.},

abstract = {Recent findings suggested a benefit of anti-EGFR therapy for basal-like muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). However, the impact on bladder cancer with substantial squamous differentiation (Sq-BLCA) and especially pure squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains unknown. Therefore, we comprehensively characterized pure and mixed Sq-BLCA (n = 125) on genetic and protein expression level, and performed functional pathway and drug-response analyses with cell line models and isolated primary SCC (p-SCC) cells of the human urinary bladder. We identified abundant EGFR expression in 95% of Sq-BLCA without evidence for activating EGFR mutations. Both SCaBER and p-SCC cells were sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs: erlotinib and gefitinib). Combined treatment with anti-EGFR TKIs and varying chemotherapeutics led to a concentration-dependent synergism in SCC cells according to the Chou-Talalay method. In addition, the siRNA knockdown of EGFR impaired SCaBER viability suggesting a putative “Achilles heel” of Sq-BLCA. The observed effects seem Sq-BLCA-specific since non-basal urothelial cancer cells were characterized by poor TKI sensitivity associated with a short-term feedback response potentially attenuating anti-tumor activity. Hence, our findings give further insights into a crucial, Sq-BLCA-specific role of the ERBB signaling pathway proposing improved effectiveness of anti-EGFR based regimens in combination with chemotherapeutics in squamous bladder cancers with wild-type EGFR-overexpression.},

abstract = {Background: Bladder cancer remains a cancer type in need of novel and alternative therapies. While multiple inhibitors of EGFR have been evaluated for efficacy in bladder cancer, the results have largely been disappointing with few patients responding to these therapies. Yet, there is a subset of patients that positively responds to EGFR inhibition with tumor shrinkage, indicating it is an effective treatment for a targeted set of bladder tumors. Objective: To derive a gene expression signature capable of predicting the response to EGFR inhibition in bladder cancer cell lines. Methods: The response to cetuximab for 68 colorectal cancer patients was used as training data to generate a gene expression signature. We applied this signature to bladder cancer cell lines and predictions were compared to the responses to seven EGFR inhibitors. Results: A novel 67-gene signature derived from colorectal cancer was able to significantly identify bladder cancer cell lines by their response to several EGFR inhibitors. Conclusions: The 67-gene signature can determine bladder cancer cell line sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. This work demonstrates a preclinical strategy to identify bladder cancer cell lines for EGFR-targeted therapy.},

abstract = {Comparison is a fundamental method of scientific research leading to insights about the processes that generate similarity or dissimilarity. In statistical terms comparisons between probability functions are performed to infer connections, correlations, or relationships between objects or samples (Cha 2007). Most quantification methods rely on distance or similarity measures, but the right choice for each individual application is not always clear and sometimes poorly explored. The reason for this is partly that diverse measures are either implemented in different R packages with very different notations or are not implemented at all. Thus, a comprehensive framework implementing the most common similarity and distance measures using a uniform notation is still missing. The R (R Core Team 2018) package Philentropy aims to fill this gap by implementing forty-six fundamental distance and similarity measures (Cha 2007) for comparing probability functions. These comparisons between probability functions have their foundations in a broad range of scientific disciplines from mathematics to ecology. The aim of this package is to provide a comprehensive and computationally optimized base framework for clustering, classification, statistical inference, goodness-of-fit, non-parametric statistics, information theory, and machine learning tasks that are based on comparing univariate or multivari-ate probability functions. All functions are written in C++ and are integrated into the R package using the Rcpp Application Programming Interface (API) (Eddelbuettel 2013). Together, this framework allows building new similarity or distance based (statistical) models and algorithms in R which are computationally efficient and scalable. The comprehensive availability of diverse metrics and measures furthermore enables a systematic assessment of choosing the most optimal similarity or distance measure for individual applications in diverse scientific disciplines. The following probability distance/similarity and information theory measures are implemented in Philentropy.

abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized by a poor prognosis and lack of targeted treatments, and thus, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Inhibitors against programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) have shown significant efficacy in various solid cancers, but their activity against TNBCs remains limited. Here, we report that human TNBCs molecularly stratified for high levels of PD-L1 (PD-L1High) showed significantly enriched expression of immune and cancer stemness pathways compared with those with low PD-L1 expression (PD-L1Low). In addition, the PD-L1High cases were significantly associated with a high stemness score (SSHigh) signature. TNBC cell lines gated for aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and CD44 stemness markers exhibited increased levels of PD-L1 versus their ALDH-negative and CD44Low counterparts, and PD-L1High cells generated significantly more mammospheres than PD-L1Low cells. Murine mammary SCA-1-positive tumor cells with PD-L1High expression generated tumors in vivo with higher efficacy than PD-L1Low cells. Furthermore, treatment of TNBC cells with selective WNT inhibitors or activators downregulated or upregulated PD-L1 expression, respectively, implying a functional cross-talk between WNT activity and PD-L1 expression. Remarkably, human TNBC samples contained tumor elements co-expressing PD-L1 with ALDH1A1 and/or CD44v6. Additionally, both PD-L1-/SCA1-positive and ALDH1A1-positive tumor elements were found in close contact with CD3-, and PD-1-positive T cells in murine and human tumor samples. Overall, our study suggests that PD-L1-positive tumor elements with a stemness phenotype may participate in the complex dynamics of TNBC-related immune evasion, which might be targeted through WNT signaling inhibition.},

We performed a comprehensive transcriptional analysis of 460 early-stage urothelial carcinomas and showed that NMIBC can be subgrouped into three major classes with basal- and luminal-like characteristics and different clinical outcomes. Large differences in biological processes such as the cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and differentiation were observed. Analysis of transcript variants revealed frequent mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in chromatin organization and cytoskeletal functions. Furthermore, mutations in well-known cancer driver genes (e.g., TP53 and ERBB2) were primarily found in high-risk tumors, together with APOBEC-related mutational signatures. The identification of subclasses in NMIBC may offer better prognostication and treatment selection based on subclass assignment.},

abstract = {Gene regulation plays a critical role in the cellular processes that underlie human health and disease. The regulatory relationship between transcription factors (TFs), key regulators of gene expression, and their target genes, the so called TF regulons, can be coupled with computational algorithms to estimate the activity of TFs. However, to interpret these findings accurately, regulons of high reliability and coverage are needed. In this study, we present and evaluate a collection of regulons created using the CollecTRI meta-resource containing signed TF–gene interactions for 1186 TFs. In this context, we introduce a workflow to integrate information from multiple resources and assign the sign of regulation to TF–gene interactions that could be applied to other comprehensive knowledge bases. We find that the signed CollecTRI-derived regulons outperform other public collections of regulatory interactions in accurately inferring changes in TF activities in perturbation experiments. Furthermore, we showcase the value of the regulons by examining TF activity profiles in three different cancer types and exploring TF activities at the level of single-cells. Overall, the CollecTRI-derived TF regulons enable the accurate and comprehensive estimation of TF activities and thereby help to interpret transcriptomics data.},

abstract = {Purpose: Even though urothelial cancer is the fourth mostcommontumor type among males, progress in treatment has been scarce. A problem in day-to-day clinical practice is that precise assessment of individual tumors is still fairly uncertain; consequently efforts have been undertaken to complement tumor evaluation with molecular biomarkers. An extension of this approach would be to base tumor classification primarily on molecular features. Here, we present a molecular taxonomy for urothelial carcinoma based on integrated genomics. Experimental Design: We use gene expression profiles from 308 tumor cases to define five major urothelial carcinoma subtypes: urobasal A, genomically unstable, urobasal B, squamous cell carcinoma like, and an infiltrated class of tumors. Tumor subtypes were validated in three independent publically available data sets. The expression of 11 key genes was validated at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. Results: The subtypes show distinct clinical outcomes and differ with respect to expression of cell-cycle genes, receptor tyrosine kinases particularly FGFR3, ERBB2, and EGFR, cytokeratins, and cell adhesion genes, as well as with respect to FGFR3, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutation frequency. The molecular subtypes cut across pathologic classification, and class-defining gene signatures show coordinated expression irrespective of pathologic stage and grade, suggesting the molecular phenotypes as intrinsic properties of the tumors. Available data indicate that susceptibility to specific drugs is more likely to be associated with the molecular stratification than with pathologic classification. Conclusions: We anticipate that the molecular taxonomy will be useful in future clinical investigations. {\textcopyright}2012 AACR.},

abstract = {Similar to other malignancies, urothelial carcinoma (UC) is characterized by specific recurrent chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations. However, the interconnection between specific genomic alterations, and how patterns of chromosomal alterations adhere to different molecular subgroups of UC, is less clear. We applied tiling resolution array CGH to 146 cases of UC and identified a number of regions harboring recurrent focal genomic amplifications and deletions. Several potential oncogenes were included in the amplified regions, including known oncogenes like E2F3, CCND1, and CCNE1, as well as new candidate genes, such as SETDB1 (1q21), and BCL2L1 (20q11). We next combined genome profiling with global gene expression, gene mutation, and protein expression data and identified two major genomic circuits operating in urothelial carcinoma. The first circuit was characterized by FGFR3 alterations, overexpression of CCND1, and 9q and CDKN2A deletions. The second circuit was defined by E3F3 amplifications and RB1 deletions, as well as gains of 5p, deletions at PTEN and 2q36, 16q, 20q, and elevated CDKN2A levels. TP53/MDM2 alterations were common for advanced tumors within the two circuits. Our data also suggest a possible RAS/RAF circuit. The tumors with worst prognosis showed a gene expression profile that indicated a keratinized phenotype. Taken together, our integrative approach revealed at least two separate networks of genomic alterations linked to the molecular diversity seen in UC, and that these circuits may reflect distinct pathways of tumor development. {\textcopyright} 2012 Lindgren et al.},

The bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables, equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R.

@article{Lange2004,
abstract = {Data clustering describes a set of frequently employed techniques in exploratory data analysis to extract "natural" group structure in data. Such groupings need to be validated to separate the signal in the data from spurious structure. In this context, finding an appropriate number of clusters is a particularly important model selection question. We introduce a measure of cluster stability to assess the validity of a cluster model. This stability measure quantifies the reproducibility of clustering solutions on a second sample, and it can be interpreted as a classification risk with regard to class labels produced by a clustering algorithm. The preferred number of clusters is determined by minimizing this classification risk as a function of the number of clusters. Convincing results are achieved on simulated as well as gene expression data sets. Comparisons to other methods demonstrate the competitive performance of our method and its suitability as a general validation tool for clustering solutions in real-world problems.},

@article{Gavai2015,
abstract = {Predicting the distribution of metabolic fluxes in biochemical networks is of major interest in systems biology. Several databases provide metabolic reconstructions for different organisms. Software to analyze flux distributions exists, among others for the proprietary MATLAB environment. Given the large user community for the R computing environment, a simple implementation of flux analysis in R appears desirable and will facilitate easy interaction with computational tools to handle gene expression data. We extended the R software package BiGGR, an implementation of metabolic flux analysis in R. BiGGR makes use of public metabolic reconstruction databases, and contains the BiGG database and the reconstruction of human metabolism Recon2 as Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) objects. Models can be assembled by querying the databases for pathways, genes or reactions of interest. Fluxes can then be estimated by maximization or minimization of an objective function using linear inverse modeling algorithms. Furthermore, BiGGR provides functionality to quantify the uncertainty in flux estimates by sampling the constrained multidimensional flux space. As a result, ensembles of possible flux configurations are constructed that agree with measured data within precision limits. BiGGR also features automatic visualization of selected parts of metabolic networks using hypergraphs, with hyperedge widths proportional to estimated flux values. BiGGR supports import and export of models encoded in SBML and is therefore interoperable with different modeling and analysis tools. As an application example, we calculated the flux distribution in healthy human brain using a model of central carbon metabolism. We introduce a new algorithm termed Least-squares with equalities and inequalities Flux Balance Analysis (Lsei-FBA) to predict flux changes from gene expression changes, for instance during disease. Our estimates of brain metabolic flux pattern with Lsei-FBA for Alzheimer's disease agree with independent measurements of cerebral metabolism in patients. This second version of BiGGR is available from Bioconductor.},

Common clustering methods often require the number of clusters to be explicitly indicated before starting the process of clustering. A preliminary step to clustering is deciding, firstly, whether the data contain any clusters and, secondly, how many clusters the dataset contains. To highlight the internal structure of data, several methods for visual assessment of clustering tendency (VAT family of methods) have been developed. The vast majority of these methods use the Euclidean distance or cosine similarity measure. In our study, we modified the VAT and iVAT algorithms for visual assessment of the clustering tendency with a wide variety of distance measures. We compared the results of our algorithms obtained from both samples from repositories and data from applied problems.},

@article{Sjodahl2022,
abstract = {Background: For muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), no tissue biomarkers are available for clinical use to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Objective: To investigate how molecular subtypes impact pathological response and survival in patients receiving preoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Design, setting, and participants: Classification of a retrospective cohort of 149 patients was performed by tumor transcriptomic profiling and immunostaining. A cohort treated with radical cystectomy alone and public data sets were used for comparison and external validation. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Complete pathological response in the cystectomy specimen (ypT0N0) and survival were compared in predefined molecular subtypes. Differential gene expression and chemotherapy response were explored beyond molecular subtypes. Results and limitations: Patients with genomically unstable (GU) and urothelial-like (Uro) tumors had higher proportions of complete pathological response (16/31 [52%] and 17/54 [31%]), versus five out of 24 (21%) with the basal/squamous (Ba/Sq) subtype following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy. Molecular subtype was independently associated with improved survival for patients with GU tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11–0.79) and UroC tumors (HR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.14–0.94) compared with Ba/Sq tumors, adjusting for clinical stage. In addition, expression of the gene coding for osteopontin (SPP1) showed a subtype-dependent effect on chemotherapy response. Conclusions: Urothelial cancer of the luminal-like (GU and Uro) subtypes is more responsive to cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A second-generation of subtype-specific biomarkers, for example, SPP1, may be a way forward to develop a more precision-based treatment approach for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in MIBC. Patient summary: This study shows that tumor classification by gene expression profiling and molecular subtyping can identify patients who are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy before radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Together with other markers for response, molecular subtypes could have a role in selective administration of such chemotherapy.},

We report a comprehensive genomic analysis of 28 cases of SARC and 84 cases of conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC), with the TCGA cohort of 408 muscle-invasive bladder cancers serving as the reference. SARCs show a distinct mutational landscape, with enrichment of TP53, RB1, and PIK3CA mutations. They are related to the basal molecular subtype of conventional UCs and could be divided into epithelial-basal and more clinically aggressive mesenchymal subsets on the basis of TP63 and its target gene expression levels. Other analyses reveal that SARCs are driven by downregulation of homotypic adherence genes and dysregulation of the EMT network, and nearly half exhibit a heavily infiltrated immune phenotype. Our observations have important implications for prognostication and the development of more effective therapies for this highly lethal variant of bladder cancer. Guo et al. report that sarcomatoid carcinoma of the bladder evolves by the progression of the basal subtype of conventional urothelial carcinoma with the enrichment of mutagenesis signature 1 and mutations of TP53, RB1, and PIK3CA. It is driven by the dysregulation of the EMT network and shows increased immune infiltrate with overexpression of PD-L1.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Previously, we described three separate methodologies to (1) correct for general levels of drug sensitivity to enable drug-specific biomarker discovery, (2) predict clinical drug response in patients and (3) associate these predictions with clinical features to perform in vivo drug biomarker discovery. Here, we unite and update these methodologies into one R package (oncoPredict) to facilitate the development and adoption of these tools.

abstract = {Several measures have been proposed for comparing nonlinear projection methods but so far no comparisons have taken into account one of their most important properties, the trustworthiness of the resulting neighborhood or proximity relationships. One of the main uses of nonlinear mapping methods is to visualize multivariate data, and in such visualizations it is crucial that the visualized proximities can be trusted upon: If two data samples are close to each other on the display they should be close-by in the original space as well. A local measure of trustworthiness is proposed and it is shown for three data sets that neighborhood relationships visualized by the Self-Organizing Map and its variant, the Generative Topographic Mapping, are more trustworthy than visualizations produced by traditional multidimensional scaling based nonlinear projection methods.},

abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex meshwork of cross-linked proteins providing both biophysical and biochemical cues that are important regulators of cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration. We present here a proteomic strategy developed to characterize the in vivo ECM composition of normal tissues and tumors using enrichment of protein extracts for ECM components and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry. In parallel, we have developed a bioinformatic approach to predict the in silico "matrisome" defined as the ensemble of ECM proteins and associated factors. We report the characterization of the extracellular matrices of murine lung and colon, each comprising more than 100 ECM proteins and each presenting a characteristic signature. Moreover, using human tumor xenografts in mice, we show that both tumor cells and stromal cells contribute to the production of the tumor matrix and that tumors of differing metastatic potential differ in both the tumor- and the stroma-derived ECM components. The strategy we describe and illustrate here can be broadly applied and, to facilitate application of these methods by others, we provide resources including laboratory protocols, inventories of ECM domains and proteins, and instructions for bioinformatically deriving the human and mouse matrisome. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids. In Euclidean geometry the mean—as used in k-means—is a good estimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains and applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second (“SWAP”) phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM algorithm. If we slightly relax the choice of swaps performed (while retaining comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by performing up to k swaps in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now explore faster intialization strategies. We also show how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from the proposed modifications.},

In this study, we target drug repurposing in the context of BC, driven by tissue omics signatures. To identify compounds that can reverse aggressive high-risk Non-Muscle Invasive BC (NMIBC) to less aggressive low-risk molecular subtypes, the next generation Connectivity Map (CMap) was employed using as input previously published proteomics and transcriptomics respective signatures. Among the identified compounds, the ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTOR, WYE-354, showed a consistently very high score for reversing the aggressive BC molecular signatures. WYE-354 impact was assessed in a panel of eight multi-origin BC cell lines and included impaired colony growth and proliferation rate without any impact on apoptosis. Overall, with this study we introduce a promising pipeline for the repurposing of drugs for BC treatment, based on patients' omics signatures.},

The complexity of published subtyping algorithms is a major impediment to understanding their biology and validating or refuting their clinical use. Here, we optimize and validate compact algorithms based on the Lund taxonomy, which separates luminal subtypes into urothelial-like (Uro) and genomically unstable (GU). We characterized immunohistochemical expression data from two muscle-invasive bladder cancer cohorts (n=193, n=76) and developed efficient decision tree subtyping models using 4-fold cross-validation. We demonstrated that a published algorithm using routine assays (GATA3, KRT5, p16) classified basal/luminal subtypes and basal/Uro/GU subtypes with 86%–95% and 67%–86% accuracies, respectively. KRT14 and RB1 are less frequently used in pathology practice but achieved the simplest, most accurate models for basal/luminal and basal/Uro/GU discrimination, with 93%–96% and 85%–86% accuracies, respectively. More complex models with up to eight antibodies performed no better than simpler two- or three-antibody models. We conclude that simple immunohistochemistry classifiers can accurately identify luminal (Uro, GU) and basal subtypes and are appealing options for clinical implementation.},

Here we assess the performance of earlier published biomarker panels for BC detection (BC-116) and monitoring of recurrence (BC-106) in combination with cytology, in two prospectively collected patient cohorts. Of the 602 patients screened for BC, 551 were found eligible. For the primary setting, 73 patients diagnosed with primary BC (n = 27) and benign urological disorders, including patients with macroscopic haematuria, cystitis and/or nephrolithiasis (n = 46) were included. In total, 478 patients under surveillance were additionally considered (83 BC recurrences; 395 negative for recurrence). Urine samples were analysed with capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. The biomarker score was estimated via support vector machine-based software. Validation of BC-116 biomarker panel resulted in 89% sensitivity and 67% specificity (AUCBC-116 = 0.82). A diagnostic score based on cytology and BC-116 resulted in good (AUCNom116 = 0.85) but not significantly better performance (P = 0.5672). A diagnostic score including BC-106 and cytology was evaluated (AUCNom106 = 0.82), significantly outperforming both cytology (AUCcyt = 0.72; P = 0.0022) and BC-106 (AUCBC-106 = 0.67; P = 0.0012). BC-116 biomarker panel is a useful test for detecting primary BC.

abstract = {Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has greatly prolonged the overall survival of cancer patients in melanoma and many other cancer types. However, only a subset of patients shows clinical responses from these interventions, which was predicated by the T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment. T cell-inflamed phenotype is characterized by the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, CD8$\alpha$/CD103-lineage dendritic cells (DCs), as well as high density of forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) that are associated with the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. A number of regulators has been associated with T cell-inflammation in the tumor microenvironment, and WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling is one of the best characterized. The tumor-intrinsic WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling activation is frequently associated with poor spontaneous T cell infiltration across most human cancers. In this article, we review the essential roles of WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling in the T cell-inflamed and non-T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment, including the development and function of immune cells, activation of immune exclusion of tumor cells, and cancer immunosurveillance. We also discuss the impact of this pathway in driving the non-T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment in other tumor types. To improve immunotherapy efficacy, we argue that targeting Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling should be a high priority for combinational cancer therapy to restore T cell infiltration.},

abstract = {The significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes among patients with bladder cancer has highlighted the existence of different biological subtypes of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Meanwhile, immune checkpoint proteins and their interference with tumor-related immune-evasive strategies has led to the development of several immunotherapeutic drugs targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). However, the lack of any known biomarker that could predict responses to immunotherapy has led to a more agnostic therapeutic approach. Here, we present a study conducted in 77 bladder cancer (BC) patients (n = 77), ranging from stages pTa to pT2. Tumor specimens were resected via transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and consistuted of 24 low-grade (LG) and 53 high-grade (HG) tumors. Patients' tumors were then categorized into molecular subtypes, via immunohistochemistry (CK5/6 and GATA3). Furthermore, all tumor specimens were stained with anti-PD-L1 and demonstrated significant correlations with basal immunophenotype, stage pT2 and HG tumors. As such, we attempted to stratify patients into groups of likely-responders and likely-not-responders to immunotherapy with anti-PD-L1, based on their molecular phenotype. Finally, in acknowledging the fact that there is a universal lack of biomarkers associated with predicting BC response to immunotherapeutic drugs, we tested all tumors for deficiency of mismatch repair proteins (MMR).},

Data are freely available without restriction. GDSC currently contains drug sensitivity data for almost 75000 experiments, describing response to 138 anticancer drugs across almost 700 cancer cell lines. To identify molecular markers of drug response, cell line drug sensitivity data are integrated with large genomic datasets obtained from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database, including information on somatic mutations in cancer genes, gene amplification and deletion, tissue type and tran-scriptional data. Analysis of GDSC data is through a web portal focused on identifying molecular bio-markers of drug sensitivity based on queries of specific anticancer drugs or cancer genes. Graphical representations of the data are used throughout with links to related resources and all datasets are fully downloadable.

One of the most appealing robust methods for principal component analysis uses the Projection-Pursuit principle. Here, one projects the data on a lower-dimensional space such that a robust measure of variance of the projected data will be maximized. The Projection-Pursuit-based method for principal component analysis has recently been introduced in the field of chemometrics, where the number of variables is typically large. In this paper, it is shown that the currently available algorithm for robust Projection-Pursuit PCA performs poor in the presence of many variables. A new algorithm is proposed that is more suitable for the analysis of chemical data. Its performance is studied by means of simulation experiments and illustrated on some real data sets. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. Results: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. Conclusions: GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data.

abstract = {Background: In previous studies, we have shown that the combination of metformin and gefitinib inhibits the growth of bladder cancer cells. Here we examined whether the metformin analogue phenformin, either used alone or in combination with gefitinib, could inhibit growth of bladder cancer cells. Methods: The growth-inhibitory effects of phenformin and gefitinib were tested in one murine and two human bladder cancer cell lines using MTT and clonogenic assays. Effects on cell migration were assessed in a wound healing assay. Synergistic action between the two drugs was assessed using CompuSyn software. The potential involvement of AMPK and EGFR pathways in the effects of phenformin and gefitinib was explored using Western blotting. Results: In MTT and clonogenic assays, phenformin was > 10-fold more potent than metformin in inhibiting bladder cancer cell growth. Phenformin also potently inhibited cell migration in wound healing assays, and promoted apoptosis. AMPK signaling was activated; EGFR signaling was inhibited. Phenformin was synergistic with gefitinib, with the combination of drugs showing much stronger anticancer activity and apoptotic activation than phenformin alone. Conclusions: Phenformin shows potential as an effective drug against bladder cancer, either alone or in combination with gefitinib.},

abstract = {At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse. The closest is perhaps Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2015), which provides an ecosystem of packages that support the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.},

abstract = {Integrated genomic analysis of 456 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas identified 32 recurrently mutated genes that aggregate into 10 pathways: KRAS, TGF-$\beta$, WNT, NOTCH, ROBO/SLIT signalling, G1/S transition, SWI-SNF, chromatin modification, DNA repair and RNA processing. Expression analysis defined 4 subtypes: (1) squamous; (2) pancreatic progenitor; (3) immunogenic; and (4) aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX) that correlate with histopathological characteristics. Squamous tumours are enriched for TP53 and KDM6A mutations, upregulation of the TP63$\Delta$N transcriptional network, hypermethylation of pancreatic endodermal cell-fate determining genes and have a poor prognosis. Pancreatic progenitor tumours preferentially express genes involved in early pancreatic development (FOXA2/3, PDX1 and MNX1). ADEX tumours displayed upregulation of genes that regulate networks involved in KRAS activation, exocrine (NR5A2 and RBPJL), and endocrine differentiation (NEUROD1 and NKX2-2). Immunogenic tumours contained upregulated immune networks including pathways involved in acquired immune suppression. These data infer differences in the molecular evolution of pancreatic cancer subtypes and identify opportunities for therapeutic development.},

abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with poor patient survival. Toward understanding the underlying molecular alterations that drive PDAC oncogenesis, we conducted comprehensive proteogenomic analysis of 140 pancreatic cancers, 67 normal adjacent tissues, and 9 normal pancreatic ductal tissues. Proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and glycoproteomic analyses were used to characterize proteins and their modifications. In addition, whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, methylation, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) were performed on the same tissues to facilitate an integrated proteogenomic analysis and determine the impact of genomic alterations on protein expression, signaling pathways, and post-translational modifications. To ensure robust downstream analyses, tumor neoplastic cellularity was assessed via multiple orthogonal strategies using molecular features and verified via pathological estimation of tumor cellularity based on histological review. This integrated proteogenomic characterization of PDAC will serve as a valuable resource for the community, paving the way for early detection and identification of novel therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Motivation: The composition and density of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) profoundly influence tumor progression and success of anti-cancer therapies. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining or single-cell sequencing are often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing. Results: We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools at estimating nine different immune- and stromal cells from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of ∼11 000 cells from the TME to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, and validated the results using independent, publicly available gold-standard estimates. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of more than a hundred thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across seven computational methods over nine cell types and ∼1800 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined cell-type signatures and propose how fuzzy cell-type signatures can be improved. We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures.},

abstract = {Background Molecular classification of bladder cancer has been increasingly proposed as a potential tool to predict clinical outcomes and responses to chemotherapy. Here we focused on mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition as a chemotherapeutic strategy and characterized the expression profile of mTOR signaling targets in representative bladder cancer cell lines from basal, luminal, and either basal/luminal (“non-type”) molecular subtypes. Materials and methods Protein and mRNA expression of mTOR signaling components from representative luminal (RT4 and RT112), basal (SCaBER and 5637), and nontype (T24 and J82) bladder cancer cell line subtypes were determined by Western blot and database mining analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Cell viability following treatment with either, Torin-2 or KU-0063794, 2 dual mTOR complex 1/2 inhibitors, was determined by MTT assay. Immunoblot analysis of cells treated with Torin-2 or KU-0063794 was performed to determine the effects of mTOR inhibition on expression and phosphorylation status of mTOR signaling components, Akt, 4E-BP1, and ribosomal protein S6. Results Molecular subtypes of bladder cancer cell lines each exhibited a distinct pattern of expression of mTOR-associated genes and baseline phosphorylation level of Akt and 4E-BP1. Cells with low levels of Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation were more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of mTOR inhibition with Torin-2, but not KU-0063794. Exposure to Torin-2 and KU-0063794 both potently and rapidly inhibited phosphorylation of Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308, and 4E-BP1 T37/46 in cell lines that included basal and nontype subtypes. Conclusions Differential gene expression and protein activity associated with mTOR signaling is observed among bladder cancer cell lines stratified into basal, luminal, and nontype subtypes. Urothelial carcinomas characterized by high baseline Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation may be best suited for targeted mTOR therapies.},

abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

abstract = {Background: While several molecular markers of bladder cancer prognosis have been identified, the limited value of current prognostic markers has created the need for new molecular indicators of bladder cancer outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify genetic signatures associated with disease prognosis in bladder cancer.Results: We used 272 primary bladder cancer specimens for microarray analysis and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Microarray gene expression analysis of randomly selected 165 primary bladder cancer specimens as an original cohort was carried out. Risk scores were applied to stratify prognosis-related gene classifiers. Prognosis-related gene classifiers were individually analyzed with tumor invasiveness (non-muscle invasive bladder cancer [NMIBC] and muscle invasive bladder cancer [MIBC]) and prognosis. We validated selected gene classifiers using RT-PCR in the original (165) and independent (107) cohorts. Ninety-seven genes related to disease progression among NMIBC patients were identified by microarray data analysis. Eight genes, a progression-related gene classifier in NMIBC, were selected for RT-PCR. The progression-related gene classifier in patients with NMIBC was closely correlated with progression in both original and independent cohorts. Furthermore, no patient with NMIBC in the good-prognosis signature group experienced cancer progression.Conclusions: We identified progression-related gene classifier that has strong predictive value for determining disease outcome in NMIBC. This gene classifier could assist in selecting NMIBC patients who might benefit from more aggressive therapeutic intervention or surveillance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Kim et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {While immune checkpoint blockade is associated with prolonged responses in multiple cancers, most patients still do not benefit from this therapeutic strategy. The Wnt-$\beta$-catenin pathway is associated with diminished T cell infiltration; however, activating mutations are rare, implicating a role for autocrine/paracrine Wnt ligand-driven signaling in immune evasion. In this study, we show that proximal mediators of the Wnt signaling pathway are associated with anti-PD-1 resistance, and pharmacologic inhibition of Wnt ligand signaling supports anti-PD-1 efficacy by reversing dendritic cell tolerization and the recruitment of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in autochthonous tumor models. We further demonstrate that the inhibition of Wnt signaling promotes the development of a tumor microenvironment that is more conducive to favorable responses to checkpoint blockade in cancer patients. These findings support a rationale for Wnt ligand-focused treatment approaches in future immunotherapy clinical trials and suggest a strategy for selecting those tumors more responsive to Wnt inhibition.},

abstract = {Direct quantification of exhausted T cells in human cancer is lacking, and its predictive value for checkpoint-based treatment remains poorly investigated. We sought to systematically characterize the pan-cancer landscape and molecular hallmarks of T-cell dysfunction for the purpose of precision immunotherapy. Here, we defined a transcriptional signature for T-cell exhaustion through analyzing differential gene expression between PD-1-high and PD-1-negative CD8+ T lymphocytes from primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), followed by positive correlation tests with PDCD1 in TCGA lung carcinomas. A 78-gene signature for exhausted CD8+ T cells (GET) was identified and validated to reflect dysfunctional immune state spanning different species and disease models. We discovered that GET estimation significantly correlated with intratumoral immune cytolytic activity (CYT) and T-cell-inflamed gene expression profile (GEP) across 30 solid tumor types. Miscellaneous tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic properties, in particular leukocyte proportions, genomic abnormalities, specific mutational signatures, and signaling pathways, were notably associated with GET levels. Furthermore, higher GET expression predicted an increased likelihood of clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. These findings highlight the interrelation between T-cell exhaustion and immune cytolytic activity at the pan-cancer scale. The resulting inflamed tumor microenvironment may further crosstalk with other molecular and clinicopathological factors, which should be properly considered during immunotherapy biomarker development. {\textcopyright} 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

abstract = {Background An early report on the molecular subtyping of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) by gene expression suggested that response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by subtype. Objective To investigate the ability of molecular subtypes to predict pathological downstaging and survival after NAC. Design, setting, and participants Whole transcriptome profiling was performed on pre-NAC transurethral resection specimens from 343 patients with MIBC. Samples were classified according to four published molecular subtyping methods. We developed a single-sample genomic subtyping classifier (GSC) to predict consensus subtypes (claudin-low, basal, luminal-infiltrated and luminal) with highest clinical impact in the context of NAC. Overall survival (OS) according to subtype was analyzed and compared with OS in 476 non-NAC cases (published datasets). Intervention Gene expression analysis was used to assign subtypes. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Receiver-operating characteristics were used to determine the accuracy of GSC. The effect of GSC on survival was estimated by Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results and limitations The models generated subtype calls in expected ratios with high concordance across subtyping methods. GSC was able to predict four consensus molecular subtypes with high accuracy (73%), and clinical significance of the predicted consensus subtypes could be validated in independent NAC and non-NAC datasets. Luminal tumors had the best OS with and without NAC. Claudin-low tumors were associated with poor OS irrespective of treatment regimen. Basal tumors showed the most improvement in OS with NAC compared with surgery alone. The main limitations of our study are its retrospective design and comparison across datasets. Conclusions Molecular subtyping may have an impact on patient benefit to NAC. If validated in additional studies, our results suggest that patients with basal tumors should be prioritized for NAC. We discovered the first single-sample classifier to subtype MIBC, which may be suitable for integration into routine clinical practice. Patient summary Different molecular subtypes can be identified in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Although cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves patient outcomes, we identified that the benefit is highest in patients with basal tumors. Our newly discovered classifier can identify these molecular subtypes in a single patient and could be integrated into routine clinical practice after further validation. Molecular subtypes in muscle-invasive bladder cancer appear have an impact on patient response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC); namely, patients with basal tumors showed the most benefit from NAC and should be prioritized for NAC. Moreover, these subtypes can be identified in a single sample by our discovered classifier.},

It plays crucial roles in all aspects of life – from orchestrating cell migration during development, to supporting tissue repair. It also plays critical roles in the etiology or progression of diseases. To study this compartment, we have previously defined the compendium of all genes encoding ECM and ECM-associated proteins for multiple organisms. We termed this compendium the ‘matrisome' and further classified matrisome components into different structural or functional categories. This nomenclature is now largely adopted by the research community to annotate ‘-omics' datasets and has contributed to advance both fundamental and translational ECM research. Here, we report the development of Matrisome AnalyzeR, a suite of tools including a web-based application and an R package. The web application can be used by anyone interested in annotating, classifying and tabulating matrisome molecules in large datasets without requiring programming knowledge. The companion R package is available to more experienced users, interested in processing larger datasets or in additional data visualization options.},

Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states.

The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools.

abstract = { Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is frequently infiltrated by immune cells, a process which is governed by chemokines. CD8 +  T cells in the RCC tumor microenvironment (TME) may be exhausted which most likely influence therapy response and survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate chemokine-driven T cell recruitment, T cell exhaustion in the RCC TME, as well as metabolic processes leading to their functional anergy in RCC. Eight publicly available bulk RCC transcriptome collectives (n=1819) and a single cell RNAseq dataset (n=12) were analyzed. Immunodeconvolution, semi-supervised clustering, gene set variation analysis and Monte Carlo-based modeling of metabolic reaction activity were employed. Among 28 chemokine genes available, CXCL9/10/11/CXCR3, CXCL13/CXCR5 and XCL1/XCR1 mRNA expression were significantly increased in RCC compared to normal kidney tissue and also strongly associated with tumor-infiltrating effector memory and central memory CD8 + T cells in all investigated collectives. M1 TAMs, T cells, NK cells as well as tumor cells were identified as the major sources of these chemokines, whereas T cells, B cells and dendritic cells were found to predominantly express the cognate receptors. The cluster of RCCs characterized by high chemokine expression and high CD8 + T cell infiltration displayed a strong activation of IFN/JAK/STAT signaling with elevated expression of multiple T cell exhaustion-associated transcripts. Chemokine high RCCs were characterized by metabolic reprogramming, in particular by downregulated OXPHOS and increased IDO1-mediated tryptophan degradation. None of the investigated chemokine genes was significantly associated with survival or response to immunotherapy. We propose a chemokine network that mediates CD8 + T cell recruitment and identify T cell exhaustion, altered energy metabolism and high IDO1 activity as key mechanisms of their suppression. Concomitant targeting of exhaustion pathways and metabolism may pose an effective approach to RCC therapy. },

Both models can be called using a single simple command line. The basic latent class model is a finite mixture model in which the component distributions are assumed to be multi-way cross-classification tables with all variables mutually independent. The latent class regression model further enables the researcher to estimate the effects of covariates on predicting latent class membership. poLCA uses expectation-maximization and Newton-Raphson algorithms to find maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters.},

abstract = {The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of personalized' therapeutic regimens. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Background: Nearly half of muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients succumb to their disease following cystectomy. Selecting candidates for adjuvant therapy is currently based on clinical parameters with limited predictive power. This study aimed to develop and validate genomic-based signatures that can better identify patients at risk for recurrence than clinical models alone. Methods: Transcriptome-wide expression profiles were generated using 1.4 million feature-arrays on archival tumors from 225 patients who underwent radical cystectomy and had muscle-invasive and/or node-positive bladder cancer. Genomic (GC) and clinical (CC) classifiers for predicting recurrence were developed on a discovery set (n = 133). Performances of GC, CC, an independent clinical nomogram (IBCNC), and genomic-clinicopathologic classifiers (G-CC, G-IBCNC) were assessed in the discovery and independent validation (n = 66) sets. GC was further validated on four external datasets (n = 341). Discrimination and prognostic abilities of classifiers were compared using area under receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: A 15-feature GC was developed on the discovery set with area under curve (AUC) of 0.77 in the validation set. This was higher than individual clinical variables, IBCNC (AUC = 0.73), and comparable to CC (AUC = 0.78). Performance was improved upon combining GC with clinical nomograms (G-IBCNC, AUC = 0.82; G-CC, AUC = 0.86). G-CC highrisk patients had elevated recurrence probabilities (P <.001), with GC being the best predictor by multivariable analysis (P =.005). Genomic-clinicopathologic classifiers outperformed clinical nomograms by decision curve and reclassification analyses. GC performed the best in validation compared with seven prior signatures. GC markers remained prognostic across four independent datasets. Conclusions: The validated genomic-based classifiers outperform clinical models for predicting postcystectomy bladder cancer recurrence. This may be used to better identify patients who need more aggressive management.},

@article{Kamoun2020,
abstract = {Background: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a molecularly diverse disease with heterogeneous clinical outcomes. Several molecular classifications have been proposed, but the diversity of their subtype sets impedes their clinical application. Objective: To achieve an international consensus on MIBC molecular subtypes that reconciles the published classification schemes. Design, setting, and participants: We used 1750 MIBC transcriptomic profiles from 16 published datasets and two additional cohorts. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We performed a network-based analysis of six independent MIBC classification systems to identify a consensus set of molecular classes. Association with survival was assessed using multivariable Cox models. Results and limitations: We report the results of an international effort to reach a consensus on MIBC molecular subtypes. We identified a consensus set of six molecular classes: luminal papillary (24%), luminal nonspecified (8%), luminal unstable (15%), stroma-rich (15%), basal/squamous (35%), and neuroendocrine-like (3%). These consensus classes differ regarding underlying oncogenic mechanisms, infiltration by immune and stromal cells, and histological and clinical characteristics, including outcomes. We provide a single-sample classifier that assigns a consensus class label to a tumor sample's transcriptome. Limitations of the work are retrospective clinical data collection and a lack of complete information regarding patient treatment. Conclusions: This consensus system offers a robust framework that will enable testing and validation of predictive biomarkers in future prospective clinical trials. Patient summary: Bladder cancers are heterogeneous at the molecular level, and scientists have proposed several classifications into sets of molecular classes. While these classifications may be useful to stratify patients for prognosis or response to treatment, a consensus classification would facilitate the clinical use of molecular classes. Conducted by multidisciplinary expert teams in the field, this study proposes such a consensus and provides a tool for applying the consensus classification in the clinical setting. An international consortium of bladder cancer expert teams establishes a consensus reconciling the diverse molecular classifications of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This work offers a robust framework that will enable testing and validating predictive biomarkers in future prospective clinical trials.},

abstract = {Purpose: Urothelial bladder cancer presents high recurrence rates, mandating continuous monitoring via invasive cystoscopy. The development of noninvasive tests for disease diagnosis and surveillance remains an unmet clinical need. In this study, validation of two urine-based biomarker panels for detecting primary and recurrent urothelial bladder cancer was conducted. Experimental Design: Two studies (total n =1,357) were performed for detecting primary (n= 721) and relapsed urothelial bladder cancer (n = 636). Cystoscopy was applied for detecting urothelial bladder cancer, while patients negative for recurrence had follow-up for at least one year to exclude presence of an undetected tumor at the time of sampling. Capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) was employed for the identification of urinary peptide biomarkers. The candidate urine-based peptide biomarker panels were derived from nested cross-sectional studies in primary (n = 451) and recurrent (n = 425) urothelial bladder cancer. Results: Two biomarker panels were developed on the basis of 116 and 106 peptide biomarkers using support vector machine algorithms. Validation of the urine-based biomarker panels in independent validation sets, resulted in AUC values of 0.87 and 0.75 for detecting primary (n =270) and recurrent urothelial bladder cancer (n = 211), respectively. At the optimal threshold, the classifier for detecting primary urothelial bladder cancer exhibited 91% sensitivity and 68% specificity, while the classifier for recurrence demonstrated 87% sensitivity and 51% specificity. Particularly for patients undergoing surveillance, improved performance was achieved when combining the urine-based panel with cytology (AUC = 0.87). Conclusions: The developed urine-based peptide biomarker panel for detecting primary urothelial bladder cancer exhibits good performance. Combination of the urine-based panel and cytology resulted in improved performance for detecting disease recurrence.},

abstract = {Background: T cells form the major component of anti-tumor immunity. A deeper understanding of T cell exhaustion (TEX) heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is key to overcoming TEX and improving checkpoint blockade immunotherapies in the clinical setting. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of TEX subsets from 9564 tumor samples across 30 bulk solid cancer types. Pan-cancer TEX subtypes were identified using literature-derived hierarchical TEX-specific developmental pathway signatures. The potential multi-omics and clinical features involved in TEX heterogeneity were determined. Findings: Our study yielded a dynamic, progressive roadmap and a hierarchical dysfunction landscape regarding TEX within the TME. In total, we identified five pan-cancer TEX subtypes, revealing tissue/cancer type-specific TEX patterns in low immunogenic tumors. By contrast, highly immunogenic tumors tend to harbor high frequencies of progenitor TEX subsets. In addition, the TEX profile also revealed distinct prognoses, intrinsic molecular subtype distribution, immune microenvironment and multi-omics features among the cancers. Network analysis identified four previously unknown TEX-associated cancer genes (tolloid-like 1, myosin heavy chain 111, P2Y receptor family member 8 and protein kinase D2), the possible association with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy response was validated using a single-cell dataset. Finally, a machine learning-based gene signature was developed to model the hierarchical TEX stages, verified in single-cell and immunotherapy patient cohorts. Interpretation: Our study provided a TEX-derived system that can be applied for the immune subtyping of cancers and may have implications for the further optimization of personalized cancer immunotherapy.

abstract = {This paper addresses the estimation of the latent dimensionality in nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the ($\beta$)-divergence. The ($\beta$)-divergence is a family of cost functions that includes the squared euclidean distance, Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Itakura-Saito (IS) divergences as special cases. Learning the model order is important as it is necessary to strike the right balance between data fidelity and overfitting. We propose a Bayesian model based on automatic relevance determination (ARD) in which the columns of the dictionary matrix and the rows of the activation matrix are tied together through a common scale parameter in their prior. A family of majorization-minimization (MM) algorithms is proposed for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. A subset of scale parameters is driven to a small lower bound in the course of inference, with the effect of pruning the corresponding spurious components. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our algorithms by performing extensive experiments on synthetic data, the swimmer dataset, a music decomposition example, and a stock price prediction task. {\textcopyright} 1979-2012 IEEE.},

The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p ≫ n case.

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * *, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {Muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs) is a group of molecularly heterogonous diseases that could be stratified into subtypes with distinct clinical courses and sensitivities to chemotherapy. Clinical application of molecular subtypes could help in prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) responders. Immunohistochemical (IHC) markers such as GATA3, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, and p53 are associated with these subtypes and are widely available. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are mutated in multiple cancers including MIBC and are potential therapeutic targets. HER2/EGFR status of MIBC subtypes has not been investigated. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed from transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURB) specimens and stained with GATA3,CK5/6,p53 and HER2 in addition to Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR for detection of EGFR gene. Of the total cases, 45% were luminal, 36.7% basal and 18.3% p53 wild subtype (p53-WT). Univariate analysis showed that overall survival (OS) and disease-free progression survival (DFS) were significantly longer for luminal subtype. In multivariate analysis, molecular subtype, HER2 status and LV invasion were independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS. Basal subtype showed a significantly better response to NAC. HER2 expression was significantly higher in luminal while EGFR expression was significantly higher in basal subtype. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed a significant longer OS and DFS for HER2 negative than positive cases. MIBC can be stratified using a simple IHC panel [GATA3,CK5/6,P53] into clinically relevant prognostic molecular subtypes. Basal tumors are aggressive and respond well to NAC while luminal have better OS. P53-WT tumors are chemoresistant and require further treatments. HER2 and EGFR are potential therapeutic targets for molecular subtypes of MIBC where luminal tumors are more likely to benefit from HER2 and basal from EGFR directed therapies.},

In general, the use of meta-analysis has been increasing over the last three decades with mental health as a major research topic. It is then essential to well understand its methodology and interpret its results. In this publication, we describe how to perform a meta-analysis with the freely available statistical software environment R, using a working example taken from the field of mental health. Methods R package meta is used to conduct standard meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses for missing binary outcome data and potential selection bias are conducted with R package metasens. All essential R commands are provided and clearly described to conduct and report analyses. Results The working example considers a binary outcome: we show how to conduct a fixed effect and random effects meta-analysis and subgroup analysis, produce a forest and funnel plot and to test and adjust for funnel plot asymmetry. All these steps work similar for other outcome types. Conclusions R represents a powerful and flexible tool to conduct meta-analyses. This publication gives a brief glimpse into the topic and provides directions to more advanced meta-analysis methods available in R.},

MDS is a family of dimensionality reduction techniques using a $n \times n$ distance matrix as input, where $n$ is the number of individuals, and producing a low dimensional configuration: a $n\times r$ matrix with $r<<n$. When $n$ is large, MDS is unaffordable with classical MDS algorithms because of their extremely large memory and time requirements. We compare six non-standard algorithms intended to overcome these difficulties. They are based on the central idea of partitioning the data set into small pieces, where classical MDS methods can work. Two of these algorithms are original proposals. In order to check the performance of the algorithms as well as to compare them, we have done a simulation study. Additionally, we have used the algorithms to obtain an MDS configuration for EMNIST: a real large data set with more than $800000$ points. We conclude that all the algorithms are appropriate to use for obtaining an MDS configuration, but we recommend using one of our proposals since it is a fast algorithm with satisfactory statistical properties when working with big data. An R package implementing the algorithms has been created.},

abstract = {This study aims to develop fatty acid metabolism-related molecular subtypes and construct a fatty acid metabolism-related novel model for bladder cancer (BCa) by bioinformatic profiling. Genome RNA-seq expression data of BCa samples from the TCGA database and GEO database were downloaded. We then conducted consensus clustering analysis to identify fatty acid metabolism-related molecular subtypes for BCa. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to identify a novel prognostic fatty acid metabolism-related prognostic model for BCa. Finally, we identified a total of three fatty acid metabolism-related molecular subtypes for BCa. These three molecular subtypes have significantly different clinical characteristics, PD-L1 expression levels, and tumor microenvironments. Also, we developed a novel fatty acid metabolism-related prognostic model. Patients with low-risk score have significantly preferable overall survival compared with those with high-risk score in the training, testing, and validating cohorts. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for overall survival prediction was 0.746, 0.681, and 0.680 in the training, testing and validating cohorts, respectively. This model was mainly suitable for male, older, high-grade, cluster 2–3, any TCGA stage, any N-stage, and any T-stage patients. Besides, we selected FASN as a hub gene for BCa and further qRT-PCR validation was successfully conducted. In conclusion, we developed and successfully validated a novel fatty acid metabolism-related prognostic model for predicting outcome for BCa patients.},

abstract = {Aberrant cell signaling can cause cancer and other diseases and is a focal point of drug research. A common approach is to infer signaling activity of pathways from gene expression. However, mapping gene expression to pathway components disregards the effect of post-translational modifications, and downstream signatures represent very specific experimental conditions. Here we present PROGENy, a method that overcomes both limitations by leveraging a large compendium of publicly available perturbation experiments to yield a common core of Pathway RespOnsive GENes. Unlike pathway mapping methods, PROGENy can (i) recover the effect of known driver mutations, (ii) provide or improve strong markers for drug indications, and (iii) distinguish between oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways for patient survival. Collectively, these results show that PROGENy accurately infers pathway activity from gene expression in a wide range of conditions. Deregulation of signalling is responsible for many cancer phenotypes. Leveraging available perturbation data, here the authors assess large-scale pathway activity patterns based on consensus downstream readout genes, enabling accurate prediction of the effects of mutations and small molecules.},

@article{Tarca2009,
abstract = {Motivation: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed (DE) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe. Results: We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that SPIA has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008.

abstract = {In humans, TGF$\beta$ signalling is associated with lack of response to immunotherapy in immune-excluded tumours; in mouse models of this immune phenotype, robust tumour infiltration by T cells and tumour regression are observed only when checkpoint inhibition is combined with inhibition of TGF$\beta$ signalling. Immune checkpoint blockade is showing clinical promise in the treatment of several cancer types, but the determinants of response need to be better established. Sanjeev Mariathasan and colleagues show that specific immune cell phenotypes and a high neoantigen burden are predictors of good responses to therapy with atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 agent, in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Lack of response to therapy is associated with increased TGF$\beta$ signalling in fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment. Combining TGF$\beta$ blockade with immune checkpoint blockade in mouse models increases the anti-tumour efficacy of the therapy, suggesting that identifying and targeting microenvironmental regulators of anti-tumour immunity may increase the reach of immunotherapy approaches. Therapeutic antibodies that block the programmed death-1 (PD-1)–programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway can induce robust and durable responses in patients with various cancers, including metastatic urothelial cancer1,2,3,4,5. However, these responses only occur in a subset of patients. Elucidating the determinants of response and resistance is key to improving outcomes and developing new treatment strategies. Here we examined tumours from a large cohort of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who were treated with an anti-PD-L1 agent (atezolizumab) and identified major determinants of clinical outcome. Response to treatment was associated with CD8+ T-effector cell phenotype and, to an even greater extent, high neoantigen or tumour mutation burden. Lack of response was associated with a signature of transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF$\beta$) signalling in fibroblasts. This occurred particularly in patients with tumours, which showed exclusion of CD8+ T cells from the tumour parenchyma that were instead found in the fibroblast- and collagen-rich peritumoural stroma; a common phenotype among patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Using a mouse model that recapitulates this immune-excluded phenotype, we found that therapeutic co-administration of TGF$\beta$-blocking and anti-PD-L1 antibodies reduced TGF$\beta$ signalling in stromal cells, facilitated T-cell penetration into the centre of tumours, and provoked vigorous anti-tumour immunity and tumour regression. Integration of these three independent biological features provides the best basis for understanding patient outcome in this setting and suggests that TGF$\beta$ shapes the tumour microenvironment to restrain anti-tumour immunity by restricting T-cell infiltration.},

An unexpectedly large number of non-oncology drugs selectively inhibited subsets of cancer cell lines in a manner predictable from the cell lines' molecular features.

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models are mathematically-structured knowledge bases that can be used to predict metabolic pathway usage and growth phenotypes. Furthermore, they can generate and test hypotheses when integrated with experimental data. To maximize the value of these models, centralized repositories of high-quality models must be established, models must adhere to established standards and model components must be linked to relevant databases. Tools for model visualization further enhance their utility. To meet these needs, we present BiGG Models (http://bigg.ucsd.edu), a completely redesigned Biochemical, Genetic and Genomic knowledge base. BiGG Models contains more than 75 high-quality, manually-curated genome-scale metabolic models. On the website, users can browse, search and visualize models. BiGG Models connects genome-scale models to genome annotations and external databases. Reaction and metabolite identifiers have been standardized across models to conform to community standards and enable rapid comparison across models. Furthermore, BiGG Models provides a comprehensive application programming interface for accessing BiGG Models with modeling and analysis tools. As a resource for highly curated, standardized and accessible models of metabolism, BiGG Models will facilitate diverse systems biology studies and support knowledge-based analysis of diverse experimental data.},

abstract = {Background: Two signalling molecules that are attractive for targeted therapy are the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR$\gamma$). We investigated possible crosstalk between these 2 pathways, particularly in light of the recent evidence implicating PPAR$\gamma$ for anticancer therapy. Principal Findings: As evaluated by MTT assays, gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor) and DIM-C (PPAR$\gamma$ agonist) inhibited growth of 9 bladder cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner but with variable sensitivity. In addition, combination of gefitinib and DIM-C demonstrated maximal inhibition of cell proliferation compared to each drug alone. These findings were confirmed in vivo, where combination therapy maximally inhibited tumor growth in contrast to each treatment alone when compared to control (p<0.04). Induction of PPAR$\gamma$ expression along with nuclear accumulation was observed in response to increasing concentrations of gefitinib via activation of the transcription factor CCAT/enhancer-binding protein-$\beta$ (CEBP-$\beta$). In these cell lines, DIM-C significantly sensitized bladder cancer cell lines that were resistant to EGFR inhibition in a schedule-specific manner. Conclusion: These results suggest that PPAR$\gamma$ agonist DIM-C can be an excellent alternative to bladder tumors resistant to EGFR inhibition and combination efficacy might be achieved in a schedule-specific manner. {\textcopyright} 2013 Mansure et al.},

abstract = {Background: Network-based analysis of gene expression through co-expression networks can be used to investigate modular relationships occurring between genes performing different biological functions. An extended description of each of the network modules is therefore a critical step to understand the underlying processes contributing to a disease or a phenotype. Biological integration, topology study and conditions comparison (e.g. wild vs mutant) are the main methods to do so, but to date no tool combines them all into a single pipeline. Results: Here we present GWENA, a new R package that integrates gene co-expression network construction and whole characterization of the detected modules through gene set enrichment, phenotypic association, hub genes detection, topological metric computation, and differential co-expression. To demonstrate its performance, we applied GWENA on two skeletal muscle datasets from young and old patients of GTEx study. Remarkably, we prioritized a gene whose involvement was unknown in the muscle development and growth. Moreover, new insights on the variations in patterns of co-expression were identified. The known phenomena of connectivity loss associated with aging was found coupled to a global reorganization of the relationships leading to expression of known aging related functions. Conclusion: GWENA is an R package available through Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GWENA.html) that has been developed to perform extended analysis of gene co-expression networks. Thanks to biological and topological information as well as differential co-expression, the package helps to dissect the role of genes relationships in diseases conditions or targeted phenotypes. GWENA goes beyond existing packages that perform co-expression analysis by including new tools to fully characterize modules, such as differential co-expression, additional enrichment databases, and network visualization.},

Memory consumption has decreased dramatically, amongst others, by replacing the old interface to the underlying compiled code by a new one relying on Rcpp. The batch SOM algorithm for training has been added in both sequential and parallel forms. A final important extension of the package's repertoire is the possibility to define and use data-dependent distance functions, extremely useful in cases where standard distances like the Euclidean distance are not appropriate.

But the limited labeled data may be imbalanced and can not cover all clusters in some cases and most of the existing semi-supervised clustering algorithms can not deal with imbalanced dataset well and have no the ability of detecting new clusters. In view of this, an adaptive semi-supervised clustering algorithm with label propagation is proposed. Two most of interesting characteristics of the proposed algorithm are that (1) It uses the limited labeled data to expand labeled dataset based on an adaptive threshold by labeling their k-nearest neighbors, (2) It detects whether there exist new clusters in the unlabeled dataset according to a proposed measure criterion. Three standard datasets are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results confirm that the accuracy of the proposed clustering algorithm is much higher than that of three compared algorithm and in addition the proposed algorithm has the ability of detecting new clusters. {\textcopyright} 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Chemokines are essential for immune cell trafficking and are considered to have a major impact on the composition of the tumor microenvironment. CX-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is associated with poor differentiation, metastasis and prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study provides a comprehensive molecular portrait of PDAC according to CXCR4 mRNA expression levels. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN The TCGA database was used to explore molecular and immunological features associated with CXCR4 mRNA expression in PDAC. A large real-word dataset (n=3,647) served for validation and further exploratory analyses. Single-cell RNA analyses on a publicly available dataset and in-house multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) experiments were performed to elaborate cellular localization of CXCR4. RESULTS High CXCR4 mRNA expression (CXCR4high) was associated with increased infiltration of regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells and macrophages, and upregulation of several immune-related genes, including immune checkpoint transcripts (e.g. TIGIT, CD274, PDCD1). Analysis of the validation cohort confirmed the CXCR4-dependent immunological TME composition in PDAC irrespective of MSI-H/dMMR or TMB. Single-cell RNA analysis and mIF revealed that CXCR4 was mainly expressed by macrophages andT cell subsets. Clinical relevance of our finding is supported by an improved survival of CXCR4highPDAC. CONCLUSIONS High intratumoral CXCR4 mRNA expression is linked to a T cell- and macrophage-rich PDAC phenotype with high expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints. Thus, our findings might serve as a rationale to investigate CXCR4 as a predictive biomarker in PDAC patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibition.},

abstract = {DNA/RNA-based classification of bladder cancer (BC) supports the existence of multiple molecular subtypes, while investigations at the protein level are scarce. Here, we aimed to investigate if Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) can be stratified to biologically meaningful groups based on the proteome. Tissue specimens from 117 patients at primary diagnosis (98 with NMIBC and 19 with MIBC), were processed for high-resolution proteomics analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The proteomics output was subjected to unsupervised consensus clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) and investigation of subtype-specific features, pathways, and gene sets. NMIBC patients were optimally stratified to three NMIBC proteomic subtypes (NPS), differing in size, clinicopathologic and molecular backgrounds: NPS1 (mostly high stage/grade/risk samples) was the smallest in size (17/98) and overexpressed proteins reflective of an immune/inflammatory phenotype, involved in cell proliferation, unfolded protein response and DNA damage response, whereas NPS2 (mixed stage/grade/risk composition) presented with an infiltrated/mesenchymal profile. NPS3 was rich in luminal/differentiation markers, in line with its pathological composition (mostly low stage/grade/risk samples). PCA revealed a close proximity of NPS1 and conversely, remoteness of NPS3 to the proteome of MIBC. Proteins distinguishing these two extreme subtypes were also found to consistently differ at the mRNA levels between high and low-risk subtypes of the UROMOL and LUND cohorts. Collectively, our study identifies three proteomic NMIBC subtypes and following a cross-omics validation in two independent cohorts, shortlists molecular features meriting further investigation for their biomarker or potentially therapeutic value.},

abstract = {Global mRNA expression analysis is efficient for phenotypic profiling of tumours, and has been used to define molecular subtypes for almost every major tumour type. A key limitation is that most tumours are communities of both tumour and non-tumour cells. This problem is particularly pertinent for analysis of advanced invasive tumours, which are known to induce major changes and responses in both the tumour and the surrounding tissue. To identify bladder cancer tumour-cell phenotypes and compare classification by tumour-cell phenotype with classification by global gene expression analysis, we analysed 307 advanced bladder cancers (cystectomized) both by genome gene expression analysis and by immunohistochemistry with antibodies for 28 proteins. According to systematic analysis of gene and protein expression data, focusing on key molecular processes, we describe five tumour-cell phenotypes of advanced urothelial carcinoma: urothelial-like, genomically unstable, basal/SCC-like, mesenchymal-like, and small-cell/neuroendocrine-like. We provide molecular pathological definitions for each subtype. Tumours expressing urothelial differentiation factors show inconsistent and abnormal protein expression of terminal differentiation markers, suggesting pseudo-differentiation. Cancers with different tumour-cell phenotypes may co-cluster (converge), and cases with identical tumour-cell phenotypes may cluster apart (diverge), in global mRNA analyses. This divergence/convergence suggests that broad global commonalities related to the invasive process may exist between muscle-invasive tumours regardless of specific tumour-cell phenotype. Hence, there is a systematic disagreement in subtype classification determined by global mRNA profiling and by immunohistochemical profiling at the tumour-cell level. We suggest that a combination of molecular pathology (tumour-cell phenotype) and global mRNA profiling (context) is required for adequate subtype classification of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

Fifty-eight genes were significantly mutated, and the overall mutational load was associated with APOBEC-signature mutagenesis. Clustering by mutation signature identified a high-mutation subset with 75% 5-year survival. mRNA expression clustering refined prior clustering analyses and identified a poor-survival “neuronal” subtype in which the majority of tumors lacked small cell or neuroendocrine histology. Clustering by mRNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and miRNA expression converged to identify subsets with differential epithelial-mesenchymal transition status, carcinoma in situ scores, histologic features, and survival. Our analyses identified 5 expression subtypes that may stratify response to different treatments.

@article{McHugh2012,
abstract = {The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity and latent variables are now widely recognized as major sources of bias and variability in high-throughput experiments. The most well-known source of latent variation in genomic experiments are batch effects-when samples are processed on different days, in different groups or by different people. However, there are also a large number of other variables that may have a major impact on high-throughput measurements. Here we describe the sva package for identifying, estimating and removing unwanted sources of variation in high-throughput experiments. The sva package supports surrogate variable estimation with the sva function, direct adjustment for known batch effects with the ComBat function and adjustment for batch and latent variables in prediction problems with the fsva function. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

abstract = {We introduce quanTIseq, a method to quantify the fractions of ten immune cell types from bulk RNA-sequencing data. quanTIseq was extensively validated in blood and tumor samples using simulated, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry data. quanTIseq analysis of 8000 tumor samples revealed that cytotoxic T cell infiltration is more strongly associated with the activation of the CXCR3/CXCL9 axis than with mutational load and that deconvolution-based cell scores have prognostic value in several solid cancers. Finally, we used quanTIseq to show how kinase inhibitors modulate the immune contexture and to reveal immune-cell types that underlie differential patients' responses to checkpoint blockers.
